###Description

This project was written on machine using Windows 7 - Service Pack 1

The project assumes you have downloaded the following files and that they have been unzipped and are available in your working directory. If you have the data stored differently or renamed any of the files, you may need to adjust the code.

Download data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

No processing was done directly to the files, all processing was completed utilizing the R script attached here

The script is intended to be run line by line and not as a fully executable program, as there are a couple of checks built in that require the user to review

The script is extensively commented with regard to step-by-step descriptions of the code.
